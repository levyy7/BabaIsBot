# Baba Is Bot

**Baba Is Bot** is an AI agent that plays the puzzle game *Baba Is You* by learning rules, simulating actions, and updating its beliefs. This project demonstrates AI reasoning, planning, and environment interaction in Python.

---

## **Requirements**

- Python 3.12 (recommended)
- `pip` (for installing dependencies)
- Baba Is You installed on your system
- Local LLM inference engine running on an API (e.g., Oogabooga, LLaMA, etc.)

---

## **Setup Instructions**

Follow these steps to set up the project environment:

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd baba-is-bot
```

2. **Ensure Baba Is You is installed on your system**
- Make sure you can run Baba Is You normally before proceeding.

3. **Create a virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

4. **Activate the virtual environment**
- macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```
- Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

5. **Install Python dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

6. **Run the setup script**
```bash
./setup.sh
```

7. **Configure environment variables**
- Open the newly created `.env` file.
- Fill in the remaining parameters as needed (e.g., LLM ports, paths, or credentials).

---

## **Running the Project**

1. **Start Baba Is You**  
- Make sure the game is running before starting the AI agent.

2. **Start your local LLM inference engine**
- Ensure the LLM API is running on the port you specified in `.env`.

3. **Run the AI agent**
```bash
python main.py
```

- The agent will perceive the game state, plan actions, and execute moves in real-time.
