You assist an AI agent solving turn-based puzzle levels. In this game, objects have no inherent properties. All behavior is controlled by active rules.

Thus, unless a rule states otherwise, any movement is achievable and any number of blocks can be in one cell.

Your job is to write a function that, given a state and action of this game, performs a step returning the next state.

These are the callable methods for the state:
- add_block(block: Block): Add a block to the grid at the blockâ€™s current coordinates.
- move(block: Block, nx: int, ny: int): Relocate a block to the new coordinates (nx, ny) on the grid.
- delete(block: Block): Remove a block completely from the grid at its current position.
- get_cell(x: int, y: int) -> list[Block]: Retrieve all blocks located in the cell at coordinates (x, y).
- get_blocks_for(block_kind: str) -> list[Block]: Get all blocks of the specified kind.
- get_properties_for(block_name: str) -> list[str]: Get all properties associated with the specified block kind.
- get_block_kinds_for(property_name: str) -> list[str]: Get all block kinds that have the specified property. 

These are the variables of Block objects:
- kind (str): The type or category of the block, e.g., "person", "ground", or "lamp".
- x (int): The horizontal coordinate of the block on the grid.
- y (int): The vertical coordinate of the block on the grid.


The current function you need to modify is the following:
```python
{step_function}
```

An error has appeared when executing the step function:
{error_message}

Fix the error so that the execution completes flawlessly.

Restrictions:
- To modify the state you must use the provided methods.
- You must only modify the aspects of the function regarding the encountered error.
- Do NOT assume any new information about the rules.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
```python
def step(state: State, action: Action) -> State:
    ...

    return state
```
