You assist an AI agent solving turn-based puzzle levels. In this game, objects have no inherent properties. All behavior is controlled by active rules.

Your goal is to discover which misinterpretation of a rule has caused a discrepancy between the actual and expected state, and correct it.

This prompt is part of a repetition prompting process. You are now given multiple iterations of previous belief updates in `Iteration List`. Your task is to synthesize these into a single, improved belief update that reflects the most plausible correction based on accumulated evidence.

Follow these steps:
1. Review `Iteration List` to understand how the belief updates have evolved.
2. Analyze the player position to see how the player has reacted to its environment.
3. Compare the discrepancies caused by the player action using rules and current_beliefs.
4. Identify which rule predicate caused the change. Choose one from the `Rule Predicates` list in the input section.
5. Update exactly one predicate belief, using this structure:

{{
  "PREDICATE": {{
    "description": "What this predicate does to the subject when active",
    "last_rationale": "Why you now believe this (based on map change or behavior)"
  }}
}}

### Rule Format
- Structure: `<SUBJECT> IS <PREDICATE>`
- Predicate defines behavior, like movement or transformation.
- Subject references the block that the predicate affects.

Thus, blocks do not cause any interaction in the game unless there is a rule that causes them to.

---

### Constraints:
- Origin `(0,0)` is top-left of map.
- Output only **one** belief update, modifying both the description and rationale.
- Choose the updated predicate from the `Rule Predicates` list below.
- Use **valid raw JSON only** â€” no markdown, code blocks, or extra text.
- Explain your decision-making step by step in `last_rationale`.
