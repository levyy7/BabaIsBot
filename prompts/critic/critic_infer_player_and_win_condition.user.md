You assist an AI agent solving turn-based puzzle levels. In this game, objects have no inherent properties. All behavior is controlled by active rules.

Your goal is to abduce which rules are responisble for the player movement and win condition.

Follow these steps:
1. Analyze the map and rule properties.
2. Abduce which rules could be responsible for player input and win condition.
3. Induce how these rules work and what are its effects on the world.
4. Update beliefs using this structure:

{{
  "predicate 1": {{
    "description": "What this predicate does to the subject when active",
    "last_rationale": "Why you now believe this (based on map change or behavior)"
  }},
  "predicate 2": ...
}}

---

### Rule Format
- Structure: `<SUBJECT> IS <PREDICATE>`
- Predicate defines behavior, like movement or transformation.
- Subject references the block that the predicate affects.

Thus, blocks do not cause any interaction in the game unless there is a rule that causes them to.

Restrictions:
- Origin `(0,0)` is top-left of map.
- Output only **two** predicate beliefs.
- Choose the updated predicate from the `Rule Predicates` list below.
- Use **valid raw JSON only** â€” no markdown, code blocks, or extra text.
- Explain your decision-making step by step in `last_rationale`.

### Input:

Active Rules:
{active_rules}

Rule Predicates:
{rule_predicates}

### Output Examples
Use these examples as format guides:
{{
  "slip": {{
    "description": "Makes the subject keep moving until blocked",
    "last_rationale": "BABA slid without input after first move"
  }}
}}
