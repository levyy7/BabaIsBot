# 🧪 BabaIsBot: Isomorphic Substitution User Study

Welcome to the user study for the **BabaIsBot** Abductive Reasoning experiment.

This study aims to evaluate whether an agent is truly engaging in abductive reasoning (inferring rules from observation) or simply relying on its prior knowledge of the game *Baba Is You*. To test this, we present game states where the **Semantics** (meaning) and **Syntax** (grammar) of the rules have been transformed.

## 📂 Folder Structure

The study material is organized by specific game mechanics (scenarios). Each scenario folder contains the visual data and the text prompts used for the experiment.

### Subfolder Details
* **`img/`**: Contains visual snapshots of the discrepancy. The agent observes a difference between its simulation (internal model) and the real game state.
* **`prompts/`**: Contains the input prompts fed to the agent. These vary based on the **State Condition** (see below).
* **`results/`**: Contains the raw output generated by the model for that specific scenario.

## 📝 Evaluation Instructions (JSON)

You are provided with a `FILLME.json` file. Your task is to evaluate the agent's performance or the clarity of the abductive reasoning process for each scenario and condition.

* **Data Type:** `Float`
* **Range:** `0.0` to `10.0`
    * **0.0**: Total Failure (Agent failed to deduce the rule / Logic is unintelligible).
    * **10.0**: Perfect Success (Agent correctly abducted the missing rule despite transformations).

### `FILLME.json` Structure
Please ensure every list inside the keys is filled with the corresponding scores.

## 📖 Substitution Dictionary (Break Semantics)

In conditions where **Semantics** are broken (i.e., `break_semantics` and `break_semantics_and_syntax`), the game entities and properties have been swapped with unrelated geometric shapes and colors to test reasoning without linguistic clues.

Refer to the tables below to decode the prompt inputs.

### 🧩 Entities Substitution

| Original Game Entity | ↔ | Substitute (Semantic Break) |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **BABA** | ↔ | **CIRCLE** |
| **ROCK** | ↔ | **SQUARE** |
| **FLAG** | ↔ | **HEX** |
| **WALL** | ↔ | **PENTAGON** |
| **SKULL** | ↔ | **TRIANGLE** |
| **LAVA** | ↔ | **OCTAGON** |
| **WATER** | ↔ | **DIAMOND** |

### 🎨 Properties Substitution

| Original Game Property | ↔ | Substitute (Semantic Break) |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **YOU** | ↔ | **GREEN** |
| **STOP** | ↔ | **RED** |
| **WIN** | ↔ | **YELLOW** |
| **PUSH** | ↔ | **BLUE** |
| **SINK** | ↔ | **ORANGE** |
| **DEFEAT** | ↔ | **CYAN** |
| **HOT** | ↔ | **BROWN** |
| **MELT** | ↔ | **WHITE** |

## 🔍 Prompt Conditions Key

* **Base:** The original game state text.
* **Rephrase:** Semantics and syntax preserved, but words are synonyms (e.g., `BABA IS YOU` -> `PLAYER CONTROLS BABA`).
* **Break Syntax:** Semantics preserved, but rule structure is broken (e.g., `YOU RELATES BABA`).
* **Break Semantics:** Syntax preserved, but words are swapped using the dictionary above (e.g., `CIRCLE IS GREEN`).
* **Break Semantics & Syntax:** Both dictionary swaps and broken rule structure are applied (e.g., `GREEN RELATES CIRCLE`).
